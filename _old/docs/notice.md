# The shipping deadline approaches

Hi there!
There's just under a week until the shipping deadline for the "Santa is a Closet Weeaboo" event is here! Please make sure you have shipped your gift and sent us confirmation in the form of a tracking number, shipping receipt and/or an order confirmation screenshot before this time.

Already shipped your gift? Please send us the aforementioned information so we have a record of it. If you've already sent this, we're sorry! 
Please resend it to us. It is likely it either didn't go through or it wasn't sent to the right place - 
**_please make sure any messages regarding the event, including but not limited to shipping confirmation; a message for your giftee; address and information updates and questions or concerns regarding the event are sent 
[directly to the /r/ClosetSanta moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FClosetSanta) rather than to a single user on the moderation team._**

As a reminder, please also let us know when you've received your gift! Feel free to brag about your awesome present on the subreddit, but reporting back to us with confirmation it has arrived means that we have a clear record of everyone who has shipped a gift as well as everyone who has received the gift shipped to them.

Thanks for taking part in the "Santa is a Closet Weeaboo" event!
