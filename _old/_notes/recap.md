Hey it's gokapaya...

Now that christmas is over and the new year has started I wanted to give a bit of a recap of ClosetSanta2016.

_insert comment about participation and rematching success_

When I randomly asked sometime in November if the something was going to happen this year I never imagined myself being the person that has to finish running it.

I talked to /u/UltimateEpicFailz and he told me how much work it was to message everybody by hand.
At first all I wanted to do was make the lifes of the people organizing this easier by giving them a little tool 
to send out messages to users.

Turns out the core people that did all this stuff last year where busy this time around.
So their asked the people in this question thread if anybody wanted to step up and take over...

In the end it came down to /u/somehokie and myself. The anonymous message bot was brought in by /u/Omnipotence_is_bliss - and I think with a little tweaking when it comes to how it shares information with
my tools it is a nice way to offer communication in this secret santa event without everyone creating throwaways or us mods having to be the relays.

With the exception of the occasional bot problems in the beginning everything went smooth. But around the end of the shipping deadline things started to grow over my head a little.
somehokie - who did basically all the modding on here (being in the US and to me it seems way more experienced in it than I am) deleted his reddit account.

I am sorry for the silence that followed. I wasn't quite sure what to doâ€¦

There are many things to improve in how the contest is run.
I think it would help to have at least 3 mods on the team.

* build everything on csv files
* google docs exports them
* easily editable
* current DB system is too heavy / complicatied
