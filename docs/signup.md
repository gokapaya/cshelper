> ClosetSanta 2016 sign-up form is now open!

Wondering what this is about?

Have a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClosetSanta/comments/5d2o32/santa_is_a_closet_weeaboo_2016_information_rules/) by /u/somehokie to find all the details about the idea and the event.

But just in case:

This is a secret santa for the anime community on reddit. 

When you sign up you will choose to _represent_ one of the subreddits that choose to participate and collaborate with us this year.
We will try our best and match you with somebody from a different subreddit than the one you represent.
Then you can start to look around for a present.

In the spirit of this secret santa we would like you to make it something "representing" **your** subreddit.
The idea is after all to get people interested in other shows & communities.
