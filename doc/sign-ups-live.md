We are a few subs short of reaching last years numbers but it's cool that we have some new ones joining :3

The sign-up form is (at least) going to be open until **November 24th**.  
We are still discussing the detailed timeline but expect something similar to the last years... with matching being done until the end of November and the shipping deadline being around early/mid December.
